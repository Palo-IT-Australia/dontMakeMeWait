# Don't Make Me Wait

A chatbot to help people make better decisions about where to go when they have a medical emergency.

# Getting Started

This project is done for the [GovHack 2018](https://2018.hackerspace.govhack.org) in the attempt to solve some challenges people facing in their hospital hassle.

# The Story

Medical emergencies are triaged by hospitals depending on the severity of the condition. This affects how long a patient must wait in an emergency department.

We use data from:
* data.nsw.gov.au (Emergency department by Local Health District)
* health.nsw.gov.au
* Google APIs

Through a simple chatbot interaction, we help people find the hospital where they are likely to spend the least amount of time waiting to be treated.

As a result we hope to reduce bottlenecks in emergency department waiting rooms.
