# Don't let me wait gov hack 2018 project
Backend app for the project created for 2018 gov hack in Sydney NSW by the team Lucky Shot

## Project description
A chatbot to help people make better decisions about where to go when they have a medical emergency.

## Data story
Medical emergencies are triaged by hospitals depending on the severity of the condition. This affects how long a patient must wait in an emergency department.

We use data from:
data.nsw.gov.au (Emergency department by Local Health District)
health.nsw.gov.au
Google APIs

Through a simple chatbot interaction, we help people find the hospital where they are likely to spend the least amount of time waiting to be treated.

As a result we hope to reduce bottlenecks in emergency department waiting rooms.
